casting is convert one datatype into another. example: if we give anything by double qutation ("") it will take as string.so it will give the output by joining the two words.

a=int("10")
b=int("20")
c=a+b
print(c)


output:  30  ( Here we denote the numbers are integer(int) . so denote its variable name )
