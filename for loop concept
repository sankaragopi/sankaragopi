for loop

    for i in "apple":
        print(i)        ---->  i is a varaiable the string "apple" is stored in the varaiable i for untill loop is summing

o/p:
    a
    p
    p
    l
    e                              note: if we give range in for loop we give bracket.if not give range or to find some interger finding give "" ---> double semi collon

2. for loop example:
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)
o/p:
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4         -------> in this method the i variable is contain the number start from 0 untill it print 4.because it contain 5 digit only in any programming language the loop work concept
                        is start from '0'
