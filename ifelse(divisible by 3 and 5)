A=int(input("Number:"))
if(A%3==0 and A%5==0):
    print("The number is divisible by 3 and 5")
else:
    print("The number is not divisible by 3 and 5")

o/p: if we give 15 its divisible by both 3 and 5.so it display the if part ("The number is divisible by 3 and 5")                  NOTE:
                                                                                                                                      And means the condition both are true only the output will excute.
                                                                                                                                      Or means the condition only one true also the output will excute.
%= means the remainder will be 0
