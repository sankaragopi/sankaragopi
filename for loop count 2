count the odd and even number between 1 to 10
sampla o/p:
        even 5
        odd 5  


even=0
odd=0
for i in range(1,4):
    if(i%2==0):
        even=even+1      
    else:
        odd=odd+1
print("Even ",even)
print("Odd ",odd)
                           explanation: Here we count 1,2,3 these three number to find even first. if it even then count even=even+1 else odd=odd+1.And the loop will execute four times 
o/p:                                    and the loop will find untill even or odd and count and print it the even count and odd count
    even 1
    odd 2                   note : The space are the main it the python program
